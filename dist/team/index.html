Dr. Pilcher is a graduate of Colgate University and the University of Rochester Medical School where he received his MD/PhD. Following neurosurgery training at the University of Rochester, he was awarded the Charles A. Ellsberg fellowship to study epilepsy and brain tumor surgery with George Ojemann, MD, at the University of Washington in Seattle. In 1990, Dr. Pilcher joined the faculty at the University of Rochester, and was appointed to Chairman in 2002. As Chairman, Dr. Pilcher grew a small clinical service consisting of 5 neurosurgeons into a nationally recognized academic and clinical enterprise. Rochester Neurosurgery Partners now provides care in all health systems in Rochester and 10 regional clinics.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="team-member-wrapper"><div class="team-member"><div class="container"><img src="../img/team/Brad_Mahon.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="Photo of Bradford Z.
